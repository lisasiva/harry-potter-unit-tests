# Harry Potter-Themed Unit Tests

These unit tests are for my fellow students of Colt Steele's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass on Udemy. Feel free to use them to double-check your workâ€”and, if you're a fellow Potterhead, to brush up on your Hogwarts trivia. I'll be adding more as I continue through the course.

## Getting Started


### 1. Download the tests directory

```

git clone https://github.com/lisasiva/harry-potter-unit-tests.git

```


### 2. Update the path to your data structure

Open the test that corresponds to the data structure you're studying. (For instance, if you're working on Section 25: Hash Tables, you'll need to open tests/hashtable.js) On line 2, update the file path.

```

// TO DO: Replace with your own path
const HashTable = require('./PATH/TO/HASHTABLE');

```

### 3. Export your data structure

At the bottom of your own file, export the data structure you coded. 

```

module.exports = HashTable;

```
